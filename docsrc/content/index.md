### Technical Take Aways

Understand how spark structured streaming allows real-time decision making in an easy-to-create and easy-to-maintain Spark Dataset environment. Paralleling the transition from RDDs to Datasets, streaming has gone from complex DStreams to easy-to-use Structured Streaming. The combination of structured streaming with DataStax allows joining streams and cassandra tables to do real-time analytics.

**Key technical note**:  the stream receives a refreshed copy of any joined cassandra tables on each stream window refresh.
